# Download Image from Google
## [googlesearchimage.py](https://github.com/mutouyu1124/Google-Image-Download/blob/master/googlesearchimage.py)
Use this script to download images from Google. If you would want more than 100 images per keyword, you would need to install Selenium library along with chromedriver from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)

Run like
```
python googlesearchimage.py -k BMW --format jpg -l 110 -t photo -o car --chromedriver ./Desktop/googlesearchimage/chromedriver -sa
```
